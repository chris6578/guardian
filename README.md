Highly configurable JSON Web Token implementation for Laravel and Lumen.
It exposes an additional authentication `guardian` driver, which can be used
like the standard `session` or `token` drivers.

[[toc]]

## Motivations
My company based its back-end on the Lumen Framework, and we had to choose a stateless identification and authentication method.
We chose to use the JSON Web Tokens which combine security and ease.
While some libraries exists like [tymondesigns/jwt-auth](https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth) or [laravel/passport](https://github.com/laravel/passport), they did not fit our requirements.

We finally decided to develop our own JWT library for Lumen, which was later ported to Laravel and share open-source.


## Acknowledgements
- JWT cryptography implementation by [`web-token`](https://github.com/web-token/jwt-framework)
- Documentation generated by [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)
- Tests run using [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) and [Mockery](https://github.com/mockery/mockery)

## Installation
Simply add Guardian to your project dependencies.

```bash
composer require mathieu-bour/guardian
```

### Laravel
Publish the default Guardian configuration:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Windy\Guardian\GuardianServiceProvider"
```

### Lumen
Copy the default Guardian configuration from `vendor/mathieu-bour/guardian/config/guardian.php` to `config/guardian.php`.
Then, add the provider to your `bootstrap/app.php` and load the configuration with:

```php
$app->configure('guardian');

$app->register(Windy\Guardian\GuardianServiceProvider::class);
```

If you want to use the `Guardian` Facade, ensure that the application is loaded with the Facades in your `bootstrap/app.php`.

```php
$app->withFacades();
```

## Alternatives

We humbly refer here to the alternatives to Guardian that we found interesting.

### [laravel/passport](https://github.com/laravel/passport)
Passport is the official Laravel library which supports JWT authentication.

> Laravel makes API authentication a breeze using Laravel Passport, which provides a full OAuth2 server implementation for your Laravel application in a matter of minutes.

### [tymondesigns/jwt-auth](https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth)
jwt-auth is a very serious alternative to Guardian which provides a higher-level API, such as authenticating users directly from the request credentials via a Facade.
jwt-auth also provides a way to blacklist the generated where Guardian let the implementation to the developer.
If you are looking for a simpler way to use JWT, we highly recommend you to take a look to this library!
